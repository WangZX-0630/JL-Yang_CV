Before you run the program, install the modules first by command:
pip install -r requirements.txt

weights files should be downloaded:
File Name: latest_net_Corr.pth  
Linkage: https://pan.baidu.com/s/10GFEzqN7EK1D7jzVQuU9tA   
Password: stdz   
Path:Damaged Road Extraction Based on Simulated Post-Disaster Remote Sensing Image/checkpoints/ade20k/latest_net_Corr.pth

File Name: latest_net_G.pth  
Linkage: https://pan.baidu.com/s/1_cSbzNC8Qacyyaqe1sErmA   
Password: 4j3w   
Path:Damaged Road Extraction Based on Simulated Post-Disaster Remote Sensing Image/checkpoints/ade20k/latest_net_G.pth

File Name: log02_dink34.th  
Linkage: https://pan.baidu.com/s/1RcUKWttbnT0peD_j6SfC8Q   
Password: 8u2t   
Path:Damaged Road Extraction Based on Simulated Post-Disaster Remote Sensing Image/weights/log02_dink34.th


Then make sure the following paths have no file:
imgs/ade20k/validation
imgs/ade20k/erased
submits/label
submits/imgs
submits/eval
submits/compare
dataset/post_disaster
dataset/pre_disaster

Also make sure the following paths have been deleted:
submits/post_disaster
submits/pre_disaster

Then run CoCosNet_test.py by command:
python CoCosnet_test.py --name ade20k --dataset_mode ade20k --dataroot ./imgs/ade20k --gpu_ids 0 --nThreads 0 --batchSize 6 --use_attention --maskmix --warp_mask_losstype direct --PONO --PONO_C  --save_per_img

User should store the original remote sensing images and their semantic segmentation masks in imgs/ade20k/validation and keep the file names in pair
like a.jpg for original remote sensing images and a.png for its semantic segmentation mask

The results are stored in the following path:
altered mask: imgs/ade20k/validation
erased mask: imgs/ade20k/erased
simulated post-disaster images: output/test_per_img/ade20k
semantic segmentation masks of pre_disaster images: submits/pre_disaster
semantic segmentation masks of post_disaster images: submits/post_disaster
initial semantic segmentation masks of damaged road: submits/compare
denoised semantic segmentation masks of damaged road: submits/img
groundtruth of damaged road: submits/label
evaluation of damaged road extraction: submits/eval
